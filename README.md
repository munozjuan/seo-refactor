## Description  

 

Working with this marketing agency I wanted the website to be up to date on accessibility standards. For the title I wanted to make sure it was concise yet descriptive. I made sure that it told the reader the name of the company and what they do. Making sure the website had semantic HTML elements. when you view the structure of the HTML elements I made sure it was independent of the styling and positioning. I made sure that all the images had alt attribute. I made sure the headings fell in sequential order. 

 

#### Technologies
